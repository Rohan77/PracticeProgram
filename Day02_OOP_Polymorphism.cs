            Polymorphism means "many forms"

            In C#, two types of polymorphism exist:

            1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):
               - Same method name with different parameter signatures
               - Resolved by the compiler at compile-time
               - Achieved using method overloading or optional parameters

            2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):
               - Achieved using inheritance
               - The base class defines a method as 'virtual'
               - Derived class overrides it using the 'override' keyword
               - Method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type

            Example:
                Animal_Poly a = new Dog_Poly();
                a.Speak(); // Will call Dog_Poly.Speak() at runtime

            Real world analogy:
                - Think of a base class called 'Payment'
                - Derived classes: CreditCard, UPI, Cash
                - You write: payment.Pay();
                - The actual object could be of any type
                - At runtime, the correct payment method is called automatically

            What if you skip virtual/override?
                - Then method binding is static
                - The base class method is always called, regardless of actual object type
                - This is called early binding or static dispatch
                - True polymorphism does not occur

            Real-world use cases where polymorphism is heavily used:

            - UI frameworks: 
              Example - Button, TextBox, Label inherit from Control; each overrides Draw()
            
            - Game engines:
              Example - GameObject base class, different NPCs or Players override behaviors

            - Dependency Injection:
              You register and resolve interface or base type, but runtime injects derived implementation

            - Design Patterns:
              Strategy Pattern, State Pattern, Template Method â€“ all rely on polymorphism to switch behavior at runtime

            Interview Tip:
            - Always mark base method as 'virtual' and child as 'override'
            - Polymorphism is central to extensible and maintainable design
            - Avoid static binding unless you are intentionally optimizing for performance or simplicity
