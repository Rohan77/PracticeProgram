            Abstraction means hiding the complex logic and exposing only the essential details

            In C#, abstraction is achieved in two ways:
              1. Abstract class
              2. Interface

            Abstract Class:
            - Declared using the 'abstract' keyword
            - Cannot be instantiated directly
            - Can contain both abstract (no implementation) and non-abstract (concrete) methods
            - Used when you want to provide a common base with some shared logic

            Real-world analogy:
            - "Payment" is abstract. You cannot perform a generic payment.
              But specific types like CreditCardPayment or UpiPayment implement the logic.

            Use cases:
            - BaseController in ASP.NET MVC
            - BaseService or BaseEntity in domain layer
            - Common logging, validation methods shared across child classes

            Difference between 'abstract' and 'virtual':
            - abstract method must be overridden
            - virtual method can be optionally overridden

            Interview Tip:
            - Use abstract class when you want to share default behavior across subclasses
            - Use interface if you only want to define a contract without any implementation
            - Don't overuse abstraction â€” keep hierarchy shallow and meaningful
