            Constructor is a special method called when an object is created.
            It initializes the object state.

            Types of Constructors in C#:

            1. Default Constructor:
               - No parameters
               - If you don't define any, compiler provides one automatically
               - Used when no specific data is passed
               - Real-world: When you sign up on a website without filling optional profile info

            2. Parameterized Constructor:
               - Accepts arguments to initialize values during object creation
               - Real-world: Booking a flight by entering name, email, age at the time of account creation

            3. Constructor Chaining:
               - One constructor calls another using 'this(...)'
               - Helps reuse initialization logic
               - Used to reuse initialization logic and reduce duplicate code
               - Real-world: Setting default country as 'India' if not provided

            4. Static Constructor:
               - Declared using 'static'
               - Called automatically before first use of the class (no manual call)
               - Used to initialize static data
               - Runs only once per type in entire application lifetime
               - Used to load static config like environment variables or license keys
               - Real-world: When a mobile app loads app settings (theme, language) once on startup

               5. Private Constructor:
                - Used in Singleton pattern to prevent external instantiation.
                - Ensures only one instance of the class exists
                - Example: Logger class that provides a single instance for logging throughout the application
                - Used to restrict instantiation from outside the class

                    public class Logger
                    {
                        private Logger() { }

                        public static Logger Instance { get; } = new Logger();
                    }
                    

            Rules:
            - Static constructor can't take parameters
            - You can't call it explicitly
            - Instance constructor runs every time you use 'new'

            Interview Tip:
            - Use constructor overloading to simplify object creation
            - Static constructor is great for initializing static variables or configuration
            - If both static and instance constructors exist, static runs first

            Why Constructors Matter in Real Projects:

            - Helps enforce required values during object creation
            Example: In an Invoice class, force invoice number and date in constructor

            - Makes object creation readable and safe
            Example: `new User("Rohan", "Admin")` is more readable than setting properties one by one

            - Static constructors help in loading shared data:
            Example: Logging configuration, database connection string, or culture info

            Interview Tip:

            - Constructor chaining is often used in base-entity classes for default timestamps
            - Static constructors are useful in Singleton patterns
            - Parameterized constructors are mandatory in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) entities

            In our previous project, we used parameterized constructors in domain models like Invoice, User, and used static constructors to initialize shared 
            configuration settings using appsettings.json


What
    Constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
    In C#, constructors have the same name as the class and no return type.
    You can overload constructors and even use static or private constructors based on design needs.

Why
    To set the initial state of the object when it's created.
    To enforce required data and logic when instantiating a class.
    Helps implement design patterns like factory, singleton, or dependency injection.

When
    When you want to provide default setup or custom initialization logic.
    When object creation needs controlled behavior (e.g., logging, validation, restricted access).
    When building a class used by frameworks (e.g., for deserialization or dependency injection).

Real-World Analogy
    A constructor is like a factory setup for a product.
    Every time a new product is made, you decide what parts to install (based on model, features).
    Some factories allow full customization (parameterized), some just build defaults (default), and some are one-time setups (static).


Best Practices
    Avoid putting heavy logic in constructors â€” use factory methods if needed.
    Use constructor injection for dependencies (used in DI frameworks).
    Keep default constructor if class is used by serializers (e.g., JSON.NET).
    Use base() to call base class constructors if inheritance is involved.
